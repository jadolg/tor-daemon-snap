This repository contains configuration to package the tor binary as a snap and run it as a daemon.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/tor-daemon)

To configure the service, edit the default configuration at `/var/snap/tor-daemon/current/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc`

This is not an "official" package distribution nor is it associated with the Tor project.
